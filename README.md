### Getting Started

```shell
$ npm install -g yo
$ npm install -g generator-react-static
$ mkdir MyApp
$ cd MyApp
$ yo react-static
```

**Step 3**. Compile and launch your app by running:

```shell
$ node run                      # Same as `npm start` or `node run start`
```

### How to Test

The unit tests are powered by [chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [mocha](http://mochajs.org/).

```shell
$ npm run lint                  # Check JavaScript and CSS code for potential issues
$ npm run test                  # Run unit tests. Or, `npm run test:watch`
```


### How to Deploy

Update `publish` script in the [`run.js`](run.js) file with your full Firebase project name as found
in your [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Note that this may have an
additional identifier suffix than the shorter name you've provided. Then run: 

```shell
$ node run publish              # Build and publish the website to Firebase, same as `npm run publish`
```

The first time you publish, you will be prompted to authenticate with Google and generate an
authentication token in order for the publish script to continue.

If you need just to build the project without publishing it, run:

```shell
$ node run build                # Or, `node run build --release` for production build
```
